This project is a final for my CSE 120 class.

In this I am making a chatbot and in the future may add another bot that is self learning
This code is based on the NLTK bots and code that lets users choose which bot to use.

Limitations: 
1. Self learning - I found it hard to find a way to create a self learning chatbot with little to no knowledge on machine learning/AI
2. Visualization of the bot - I tried to create a visual of the chat using PyGame but could not get the output of the bot into an image for PyGame to put on a window

Future Production:
1. Adding more rules for the bot to follow - There is a limited amount of rules that are in now
2. Adding more bots - I am thinking about having more bots like one that is based on selling certain products
